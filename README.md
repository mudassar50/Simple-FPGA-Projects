# Simple-FPGA-Projects
To implement Chisel code on an FPGA, follow these steps:
1.	Write Chisel Code:
o	Create your Chisel design in Scala.
2.	Generate Verilog:
o	Use the Chisel build tools (e.g., sbt) to compile your Chisel code and generate the corresponding Verilog files.
3.	Create a Vivado Project:
o	Open Xilinx Vivado and create a new project targeting your specific FPGA (e.g., Artix-7 XC7A35T).
4.	Add Verilog Files:
o	Import the generated Verilog files into your Vivado project.
5.	Create Constraints File:
o	Create or modify a .xdc constraints file to assign pins for inputs, outputs, and clock/reset.
6.	Run Synthesis:
o	Synthesize the design in Vivado to check for errors and optimize the logic.
7.	Run Implementation:
o	Implement the design to place and route the logic onto the FPGA.
8.	Generate Bitstream:
o	Generate the bitstream file (.bit) for programming the FPGA.
9.	Program the FPGA:
o	Use Vivado's Hardware Manager to upload the generated bitstream to your FPGA board.
10.	Test the Implementation:
o	Verify functionality by testing the implemented design on the FPGA hardware.
