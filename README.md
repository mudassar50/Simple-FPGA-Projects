# Chisel Implementation on FPGA

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple implementation of a digital design using Chisel, a hardware construction language. The design is intended to be synthesized and programmed onto an FPGA.

## Features
- **Chisel Design**: A basic example of hardware design written in Chisel.
- **Verilog Generation**: Automatically generates Verilog code from the Chisel design.
- **FPGA Implementation**: The generated Verilog can be implemented on an FPGA board (Artix-7 XC7A35T).

## Requirements
- **Scala**: Make sure Scala is installed on your system.
- **SBT**: The Scala Build Tool is required to build the project.
- **Xilinx Vivado**: Installed and set up to synthesize and program the FPGA.
